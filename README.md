Habit-forming is not an easy task, and maintaining good habits consistently can be a challenging
feat. However, in today’s socially charged world, there is no reason why building healthy habits
shouldn’t be fun and interactive. Enter Habitopia, the gamified app designed to make habit-
forming fun, social, and engaging. Habitopia is an app that allows users to register, log in,
and participate in challenges where they can build good habits with a group of like-minded
individuals. Users can check in to show participation in the challenge and follow people, view
the leaderboard, and chat with others in a group chat. Habitopia aims to gamify the habit-
forming process, making it more fun and engaging for users. We aimed to create an app that
users can easily navigate and use to build sustainable habits, track their progress, and connect
with other users in a social environment.

Apple places restrictions on the Expo Go app. These restrictions mean that if you are on iOS then you will need to be a member of our developer organisation to access the app within Expo Go.
