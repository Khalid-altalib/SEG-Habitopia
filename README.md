# Habitopia

A social media app that turns habit-building into a multiplayer game supercharged with social accountability.

## An overview of the technologies used

- React Native
- TypeScript
- Expo
- NativeBase
- AWS Amplify

## Accessing the deployed version

Download the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app from the Android Play Store or the Apple App Store.

Expo Go allows us to share the deployed version of the app without paying for an Apple Developer Programme licence or joining the Android Developer Programme.

Apple places restrictions on the Expo Go app. These restrictions mean that if you are on iOS then you will need to be a member of our developer organisation to access the app within Expo Go. We have created a dummy member account for this purpose. Within the Expo Go app, click the log in button and use the following user details:

- Email: habitopia@mail.com
- Password: habitopia

Go to the [app page](https://expo.dev/@habitopia/habitopia?serviceType=classic&distribution=expo-go) on the Expo Store.

Follow the instructions on the app page to load the Habitopia app within Expo Go.
